# Church Schedule (HCM District Focus)

This application provides a schedule of church services and events, initially focusing on churches within a specific Ho Chi Minh City district.

## About

This project aims to create a centralized resource for finding church service times and event information in a convenient mobile or web application. For the first release, we are concentrating on gathering and displaying data for churches within a designated Ho Chi Minh City district. This allows us to refine the application and ensure data accuracy before expanding to other areas.

## Features (Initial Release)

* **District-Specific Church Listings:** Displays a list of churches within the selected district.
* **Service Schedule:** Shows service times for each listed church.
* **Event Calendar:** Provides information about upcoming events at participating churches.
* **Basic Church Information:** Includes church name, address, and contact details.
* **Simple and User-Friendly Interface:** Easy navigation and clear presentation of information.

## Future Plans

* Expand coverage to include all districts within Ho Chi Minh City.
* Add filtering and search functionality.
* Implement user accounts for personalized schedules and notifications.
* Incorporate map integration for church locations.
* Add multi-language support.
* Add notification for specific church events.
